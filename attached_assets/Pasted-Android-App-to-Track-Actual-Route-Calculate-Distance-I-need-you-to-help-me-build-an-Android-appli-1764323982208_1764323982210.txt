Android App to Track Actual Route & Calculate Distance

I need you to help me build an Android application with the following features.
The main purpose of the app is to track the worker’s actual travel route using continuous GPS logging and calculate total distance based on the real path traveled, not just the difference between start and end points.

📌 Core Functionalities
1. Trip Tracking

The app must allow the worker to track daily trips. A trip consists of:

Start Trip → record timestamp + GPS location

End Trip → record timestamp + GPS location

Continuous GPS logging during the entire trip

Calculate the total distance of the trip based on the ACTUAL route traveled (sum of all distances between sequential GPS coordinates)

Calculate travel allowance automatically based on the total distance

2. Site Visits

During an active trip, the user can record site visits:

Record arrival time + GPS location

Record departure time + GPS location

Associate these details with the current trip

3. GPS Route Logging

While a trip is active, the app must:

Continuously capture GPS coordinates

Save them into the local database

Use them to compute the real distance traveled (e.g., using Haversine formula between each logged point)

📱 User Interface
Main Screen

Shows:

Total distance traveled today

Total travel allowance earned

Timeline of events (Leave Home → Arrive at Site → Depart Site → Return Home)

Quick Action Buttons

Start Trip ("Leave Home")

Record Site Arrival ("Arrive at Site")

End Trip ("Return Home")

Site Details

A floating action button to add site-specific notes or info.

Bottom Navigation Tabs

Trip History – list of all past trips

Reports – summary or export functions

Profile – user information and settings

🗄️ Local Data Storage

Use Room Database to store:

Trip data

Site visit details

All GPS coordinates logged

User info

📍 Location Services

Use Google Play Services (FusedLocationProviderClient):

Request high-accuracy location

Fetch continuous location updates

Run efficiently in background when trip is active

❗ Important Change From Original Description

The app must not calculate distance as the straight-line difference between the start and end points.
Instead, it must:

Track the actual route traveled using continuous coordinates

Calculate distance by summing point-to-point movement

Produce the true real-world distance traveled by the worker

🎯 Deliverables Needed

Full Android Studio project (Kotlin preferred)

Room database setup

Location service helper

UI screens

Distance calculation algorithm using real route data
